Hi, my name is Donella but people know me as **Nella**. 

I am:

*Creative*
*Optimistic*
*Resourceful*

**My favorite hobby is creating short films!** From shooting footage to editing and adding sound effects, I have a deep found love for creating a movie and bringing it to life the way I invisioned it.  **My favorite animal is my dog Mocha.** The statement *"Dogs are a mans best friend"* is so true, my dog has been by my side through the ups and downs. I think everyone should have a sidekick!
